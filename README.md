Project Step 2
Get Buckets Shot Counter

# Introduction
The idea that I chose to go with was my idea for the shooting site. I chose this one, because the addition of information is a lot more frequent than the other two that were mentioned in my first project. My goal is to help basketball players to self-improve their shooting skills by tracking their progress of shooting over time.


As stated before, this idea is inspired my love for basketball. I have played and loved basketball for as long as I can remember. Now that I have a daughter that plays, I wanted to come up with something that may help her improve in ways that I did not have when I played. That is why I came up with the idea for her to start tracking her progress with her shooting. I believe that it is a lot easier to see what you need to improve on if you can actually see what you need to improve on. This application will be used to document and track all her shots in order to attack her trouble areas and improve on the areas that she is already doing well. To do this, this application will allow you to see all your shots that are made from different positions by two different means.

# Tracking by Quantity
The first way of tracking would be with the use of quantity and percentage. The user would be able to set a specific number of shots that they will be taking at any giving time. For instance, if the player wanted to see how many shots, they can make out of 50, all they would have to do is input the overall number of shots taken, in this case 50, and add in the number of shots made. This will help the use determine which position of the court they need the most improvement. They will also be able to see what percentage they are shooting, because the application will give you that total percentage based off the information submitted.

# Timed Shots
The second way of tracking will be time based. Like the first method, this way will also track how many shots were made. The difference would be that this way would track how many shots were made in a specific amount of time. While the first way is more of a way to improve on the fundamentals of shooting, this one would focus more on the person’s accuracy in more of a real time scenario. A scenario where you are in a game and are literally racing against a shooting clock. Also, like the first method, you would be able to input the amount of time you want to shoot for. For example, you can input how many shots you made in a minute and document those results within the application. Now the application will just be able to show the number of shots taken in a certain amount of time. It will not have a countdown option. The user will have to find other means of doing that. 

# Type of Shots Taken
As mentioned, both input methods will be based off of different positions and shots from the court. To keep it simple, I decided to use the four main shots that I like and prefer. The first being the layup. I feel that if you do not know how to make any other shot on the court, the layup is the most essential. Next there would be the field shot. This is a shot that is used by mostly forwards. It is typically taken anywhere between out of the post position key and inside of the three-point line. Then there is the free throw. This is this line where a shooter would take a certain number of uncontested shots. Lastly, you have the famous three pointers. The shot that is taking outside of the arched line furthest from the goal. I am a big fan of the bank shot as well, but not sure if it is one of those shots that is a “must have”. Maybe I will make it to where a user can add in the shots that they feel they need to work on or add to their arsenal of shots.

# Conclusion
So, this is my idea that I chose to do my project on. I believe that it is something that can benefit a lot of people, and I also believe that it is something that my and my daughter would be using a lot of as she moves forward with her playing basketball.
